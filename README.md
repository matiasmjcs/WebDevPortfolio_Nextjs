# Frontend Developer
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a dedicated frontend developer with a strong focus on creating intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces. I have extensive experience in React, Next.js, and Vue.js, along with other frontend technologies. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with WebAssembly (WASM).

In addition to my frontend skills, I also possess knowledge and experience in integrating web3 technologies into applications. I am familiar with tools such as Web3.js and Ethers.js, enabling me to interact with Ethereum networks and smart contracts.
